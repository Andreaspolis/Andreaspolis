# Hello, world!
## Iâ€™m Andreaspolis
- Iâ€™m just a guy from Estonia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª interested in programming
- I started with Roblox Lua, but I have since learned C, GDScript and a bit of Kotlin(Jetpack Compose), Rust and JS
- I like creating 2D applications most as I am not too fond of crazy complexity (thus I also have no interest in AI)
- I currently only work on personal projects, but who knows, maybe I'll work on some open-source projects too in the future :)
